# Carrot-in-a-Box - Game
## How it works
There are two boxes. One of the boxes has a carrot in them. The first player can look into one box. Now
the first player knew where the carrot is. Then the second player can decide to switch boxes or not. So the
secod player has to look at the first player and see if the player is bluffing or not. The winner is the
person with the carrot in the box.
