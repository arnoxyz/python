# Black Jack
Black Jack is a game against the house (the dealer). You draw a card then the dealer draws two cards. One face up (meaning you can see what it is), the other card of the dealer is upside down. You can now get another card or stay. The goal is to win against the dealer or get a score of 21 (all face cards are counted 10 except the queen she can be 1 or 11, all other cards are there value so 6 is 6, 7 is 7 and so on...)

## How to play:
### Your Turn: Start
You get two cards. 
- If you get 21 = You win, congrats

- If you have less than 21, you can either get another card or stay: 
    you can get as many cards as you would like until
    - you get 21 
    - or you bust (get over 21))
    - or you stay 

### Dealers Turn: You stay and have under 21 and also not 21, what now?
If you are close to 21 like 19 you should stay, then the dealer is on the turn. The dealer now shows you the second card. This depends on the rules but the dealer can also get more cards but there is a upper limit for that like 17. So the dealer can get more cards when the dealers score is under 17. 

- If the dealer gets more than 21 you automaticall win (if you lost before, the dealer wins and has not to play) 
- If the dealer hat less than you, you win. 
- If the dealer has over 21, then you win.
