# Birthday Paradox
Is the high propability that even in a small group of people there is a high 
chance that there are two people with the same birthday.

This is because birthdays are not even distributed, all humans are different we just
behave same. My best friend in school had the same birthday as me. :)

This program generates birthdays over and over again. After each birthday list it generates, the program checks if there is a birthday pair (two people with the same birthday)  
If it is -> win
If not   -> lose

After that it checks wins vs loses. This is the likelihood

Probability that (at least) two people have same birthday = Wins / All Results
