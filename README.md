# Python Learning Log
I want to review and learn new Python concepts.
This is best done through *learning by doing*, so I'll start by writing small Python programs.
For this, I'm using the book **_The Big Book of Small Python Projects_** by *Al Sweigart*.

## Overview

### 01. Bagels
A number-guessing game, similar to the High-Low game.

### 02. Birthday Paradox
Simulates the birthday paradox â€” the surprisingly high probability that, even in a small group of people, two individuals share the same birthday.

### 03. Bitmap Message
Prints a predefined picture using a given input string.

### 04. Blackjack
Console implementation of the famous gambling game called Blackjack or 21.

### 05. Bouncing Logo (DVD Standby Logo)
Recreates the classic DVD recorder standby screen, with the option to have multiple logos at once.
There are two versions:
- One behaves like the original.
- The other leaves visible trails behind moving logos by not erasing previous positions.

### 06. Caesar Cipher
A way to encrypt messages by shifting the alphabet by a specific number (key).
Decryption is done by shifting the encrypted message by the same key just in the opposite direction.

### 07. Caesar Hacker
Demonstrates how easy it is to crack a Caesar cipher by generating and printing all possible shifts.
This reveals the correct message somewhere among the results.

### 08. Calendar Maker
Neatly prints a calendar for a given date in the console.

### 09. Carrot in a Box
A two-player bluffing game. Each

### 10. Cho (even) / Han (odd)
A simple Japanese dice game in which the player bets on whether the sum of two dice is even ("Cho") or odd ("Han").
